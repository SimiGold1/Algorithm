# Algorithm
This solves an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

Instructions
The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.

Key Points: 
Each character will be treated separately.
The last character is the point.
Use three variables as counters.
Solution:
The code consists of three sections, each serving a specific purpose. Here's how you can use each section:

Length of the Sentence:

Assign the sentence you want to analyze to the sentence variable.
The code will output the length of the sentence, including spaces and punctuation marks.

Number of Words in a Sentence:
Use the wordCount function, passing the sentence as an argument.
The code will split the sentence into individual words and return the count of words.

Number of Vowels in the Sentence:
Assign the sentence you want to analyze to the sentence variable.
The code will count the number of lowercase vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') in the sentence and output the count.
